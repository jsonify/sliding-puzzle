# Leaderboard Enhancement Plan

## Current State
The leaderboard currently provides basic functionality:
- Stores best moves and time per grid size/difficulty
- Shows simple stats in a grid layout
- Updates automatically when records are broken
- Uses localStorage for data persistence

## Enhancement Goals
1. **Improved Data Structure & Management**
   - Add timestamp tracking for all attempts (not just best)
   - Store recent games history
   - Track global statistics (total games played, total time, etc.)
   - Implement data migration strategy for existing records

2. **Enhanced User Interface**
   - Add sorting options (by grid size, difficulty, date)
   - Implement filters for different achievement types
   - Create an achievements system with badges
   - Add animations for new records
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add tabs for different leaderboard views

3. **Engagement Features**
   - Personal statistics dashboard
   - Progress tracking over time
   - Achievement badges for milestones:
     * "Speed Demon" - Complete under 30 seconds
     * "Efficiency Expert" - Complete in minimum moves
     * "Grid Master" - Complete all difficulties
     * "Perfect Score" - Best time and moves
   - Recent achievements showcase
   - Share buttons for social media

4. **View Modes**
   - Global Records: Best overall scores
   - Recent Games: Latest completions

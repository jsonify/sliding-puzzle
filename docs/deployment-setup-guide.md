# Implementation Steps for Development/Production Workflow

## Initial Setup

1. **Set up development branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b development main
   git push -u origin development
   ```

2. **Configure Vercel Project:**
   1. Navigate to your project in the Vercel dashboard
   2. Go to Settings > Git
   3. Under "Production Branch", add the `development` branch as a production branch
   4. Configure Production Branch Settings:
      - Set "main" branch for production deployments
      - Enable auto-deployment

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   1. In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings > Environment Variables
   2. Click "Add New"
   3. Add environment variables for both Production and Preview environments
   4. Ensure `.env.development` and `.env.production` are properly configured locally

## Branch Protection Setup

1. **GitHub Repository Settings:**
   1. Go to repository Settings > Branches
   2. Click "Add rule"
   3. For "main" branch:
      - Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"
      - Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
      - Enable "Include administrators"
   4. Create another rule for "development" branch with similar settings

## Testing the Setup

1. **Create a test feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git checkout -b feature/test-deployment
   ```

2. **Make a small change and test the workflow:**
   1. Make a minor change to the codebase
   2. Push to the feature branch
   3. Create PR to development
   4. Verify Vercel preview deployment
   5. Merge to development
   6. Verify staging deployment
   7. Create PR to main
   8. Verify production deployment

## Verifying Deployments

1. **Check Development Environment:**
   - Visit the development URL (dev.sliding-puzzle.vercel.app)
   - Verify that changes appear correctly
   - Test functionality in the development environment

2. **Check Production Environment:**
   - Visit the production URL (sliding-puzzle.vercel.app)
   - Verify that the stable version is running
   - Ensure no development changes are present

## Next Steps

1. **Update Documentation:**
   - Add deployment workflow documentation to README
   - Document branch strategy
   - Document PR process

2. **Team Communication:**
   - Share new workflow documentation
   - Schedule team training if needed
   - Set up PR templates

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up monitoring for both environments
   - Configure alerts for deployment failures
   - Establish rollback procedures

## Important Notes

- Always create feature branches from `development`
- Keep `development` up to date with `main`
- Regular testing in staging environment
- Proper PR reviews before merging
- Monitor deployment status in Vercel dashboard
